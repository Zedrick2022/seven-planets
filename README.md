            <h1>
            NISSU and NATAU's union are being blamed for not doing their job as they promised to Youth Security Service employees under National Youth Service.
            </h1>
            <p class="Hero">
            Employees of Youth Security Service which is a department falling under National Youth Service of Namibia are complaining of their unions not doing their job as lawyers. Employees state that it has been for months to almost a year that they have been waiting for increments to their salary from last year, until now without a change.
            </p>
            <h2>A question from employees, are unions getting something from National Youth Service's big<strong>Dogs</strong> to silence them?</h2>
            <p class="hero"> 
            Without an answer, employees send in a lot of requests to their office for strikes and demonstrations in order for them to have better finance to manage their wellbeing's needs. 
           Why is the union quiet..? do you have something in the mouth..? Mufuntile kapa bule..? Why do employees get deduction from their salary into Union's account..?</p>
            <p class="heroes">It is said that, there is always a problem from their office in responding to employees, whether to go on with strike/demonstration.
           The National Youth Service office normally has come up with a strategy of either delaying Employees's salary. By delaying payments distract employees's mission to strike/demonstrate but they would rather focus on claiming their payments only and without increments.</p>
           <h5>Is it still National Youth Service or it's now National Old Service of Namibia ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¦</h5> <p class="read">It is now turning to National Old Service, it is had that only old people do enjoy the wealth of this organization by traveling to claim snts and at the end telling the Youth of the country that there's no money. They say all what want to convince the Youth about lack of money in the organization, while they are busy overloading their bellies.</p> <hr>
